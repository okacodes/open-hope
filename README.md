## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node, MongoDB, Express, Passport, Flash, Mongoose, EJS 

Open Hope is a platform designed for animal shelters and rescues. It allows these organizations to register and display the animals that are in their care at the moment. It aims to provide an alternative to clunky and expensive alternatives that are currently available. Passport enables both local authentication and the use of OAuth.

## Optimizations

(Will be added over time...)

## Lessons Learned:

1. A lot of methods in Mongoose no longer accept callbacks.

(More will be added over time...)
